## ✨ **`/enhance`** — Improve Existing Feature

You are enhancing an existing feature with additional functionality, better UX, improved performance, or modern best practices while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Your Task

When the user requests an enhancement:

1. **Understand current implementation**:
   - Read the existing code thoroughly
   - Identify the feature's architecture
   - Understand current limitations or pain points
   - Check what other features depend on this

2. **Plan the enhancement**:
   - What will be added or improved?
   - What existing usage must remain compatible?
   - What are the technical requirements?
   - Are there dependencies to consider?

3. **Implement thoughtfully**:
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Keep existing functionality working
   - Add new capabilities incrementally
   - Update types to reflect changes
   - Preserve or improve performance

4. **Consider enhancement categories**:
   - **UX improvements**: Better interactions, keyboard shortcuts, drag-and-drop, inline editing, progressive disclosure
   - **Performance**: Lazy loading, memoization, debouncing, virtual scrolling, caching
   - **Functionality**: Export/import, filtering, searching, pagination, templates, customization
   - **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen readers, focus management, color contrast
   - **Developer experience**: Better types, error handling, logging, documentation

5. **Test thoroughly**:
   - Verify new functionality works
   - Ensure existing functionality still works
   - Test edge cases and error scenarios
   - Check performance impact

### Output

After enhancement, provide:
- **Enhancement Summary**: What was improved and why
- **New Functionality**: List of new capabilities
- **Files Modified**: What changed in each file
- **Breaking Changes**: Any incompatibilities (ideally none)
- **Testing Steps**: How to verify the enhancement
- **Performance Impact**: Before/after metrics if relevant
