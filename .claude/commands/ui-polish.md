## ðŸŽ¨ **`/ui-polish`** â€” Polish UI/UX

Enhance and refine user interface for consistency, accessibility, aesthetic polish, and delightful user experience.

### Your Task

When the user requests UI polish:

1. **Assess current UI**:
   - Visual consistency (spacing, colors, typography, borders, shadows)
   - Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Interaction states (hover, active, focus, disabled, loading)
   - Accessibility (keyboard, screen readers, contrast, labels)
   - User feedback (loading indicators, success/error messages, empty states)

2. **Identify polish opportunities**:
   - **Visual**: Inconsistent spacing, misaligned elements, weak hierarchy, poor contrast
   - **Interaction**: Missing hover states, unclear feedback, abrupt transitions
   - **Responsive**: Mobile usability issues, touch targets too small, layout breaks
   - **Accessibility**: Missing ARIA labels, poor focus indicators, keyboard navigation gaps
   - **Micro-interactions**: No loading states, harsh transitions, missing animations

3. **Implement polish**:
   - Align to design system (use existing component library)
   - Add smooth transitions and animations
   - Implement skeleton loading states
   - Enhance empty states with helpful illustrations and actions
   - Improve form UX (validation feedback, autofocus, keyboard shortcuts)
   - Add hover and focus states to all interactive elements
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness and touch-friendly sizes
   - Add accessibility attributes (ARIA, alt text, labels)

4. **Test thoroughly**:
   - Visual regression on all screen sizes
   - Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape)
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Color contrast validation
   - Animation performance (60fps)
   - Reduced motion preference

### Output

After polishing, provide:
- **Summary**: What was improved
- **Visual Enhancements**: Layout, spacing, typography, color adjustments
- **Interaction Improvements**: States, animations, feedback mechanisms
- **Accessibility Fixes**: WCAG compliance items addressed
- **Responsive Updates**: Mobile/tablet improvements
- **Testing Recommendations**: How to verify the polish
